# ImageClassification
Inquire within for some rad codes on my machine learning image classifier projects

This repository contains an image classifier trained to identify cars, trucks, suvs, and beetle vehicles. The training data set consisted of images of Toyota Camrys, Ford F-150s, GMC Acadias, and Volkswagon Beetles. The test images in the repository are representative of easy and hard tests for the image classifier.
